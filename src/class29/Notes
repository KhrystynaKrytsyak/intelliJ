Set Review :
 -set in Java does not allow duplicate values.
 There are many types of sets but we will only discuss the most widely used ones which are:


HashSet:
  Upside: fastest of all;
  Downside: no insertion order is maintained;

LinkedHashSet:
 Upside: insertion order is maintained;
 Downside: retrieval of the elements will be super slow;
           insertion speed slower than HashSet;

TreeSet:
 Upside: elements will always be sorted in natural order(alphabetical);
 Downside:  insertion speed is slowest of all ( because everytime we insert
 it compares with all existing and only then inserts)

 NOTE:
 1. They are mostly used to remove duplicates.
 ==================================================================================================

 Map:
 --> allow us to store key value pairs. First, entry is treated as key, and the second one is treated as a value.
 Keys cannot be duplicate but values can be.
 Map<Integer, String> items = new HashMap<>();

1. HashMap
     Upside: fastest when it comes to insert and retrieve the elements;
     Downside: no insertions order;

 2. LinkedHashMap
     Upside: insertion order will be maintained;
     Downside: retrieval will be slowest;

 3. TreeMap
     Upside: data will be stored in the sorted form based on key;
     Downside: insertion is the slowest;

 Choose proper DataStructure:
 Q1. I want to store unique names in the sorted form.
 A: TreeSet;

 Q2. I want to store the names of the students and most of the time i will be
    performing operation related to data retrieval based on index.
 A: ArrayList

 Q3: I want to store items names and their prices and I want to maintain insertion order
 A: HashMap
