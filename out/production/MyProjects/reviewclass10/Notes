Method Overriding :
    - When same method exists in parent and child class
Why we should use method overriding?
    - Same method can behave differently on different objects. It allows us to achieve polymorphism.
What is the syntax to achieve method overriding?
    -Redefine the method with same header inside the child class.

Class Parent {
void sleep() {
sout"i sleep 8 hours"
}
}
class Child extends Parent {
void sleep(){
sout "i sleep 6 hours"
}

public static void main (String[] args) {
Parent parent = new Child();
parent.sleep();
}
}

Rules of polymorphism:
1. There should be inheritance between classes.
2. Method header should be same (access modifiers return type method name parameters)
3. We cannot override the private methods because private methods don't participate in inheritance
4. Constructors cannot be override because they also don't participate in inheritance
5. We can only increase the visibility of a method inside the child class but we cant decrease it.
    For example, if a method is declared protected or default we can change it to public, but we cant do the reverse.
6. We cant override static methods.
7. Methods that are declared with the final keyword can't be overridden.
==================================================================================================================
Final KeyWord:
    -final in java represent completeness. If something is complete and does not need any modification then we ise the keyword with that entity

    1. when final is used with properties/fields/instance variable we cannot reassign those variables.
    2. when used with methods, these methods cannot be overridden in child classes.
    3. when used with class names no other class can inherit from that class.
==================================================================================================================

Abstraction:
    - is hiding the implementation details and only showing the functionality

Why we should use Abstraction?
    - with the help of abstraction we can reduce the complexity of code by only focusing on the input/output
    of a method instead of focusing on the logic of that method.

What is the syntax for abstraction:
    - whenever we have to create abstract methods we don't provide the implementation /body of the methods
    we only provide the header of the method amd we use the abstract keyword

Rules :
    1. Abstract methods cant have a body.
    2. Abstract classes can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
    3. Abstract classes cant be instantiated (cant create object of that class).
    4. Abstract classes cant be declared final.
    5. We use abstract keyword for abstract classes and methods.
    6. if we inherit, child class has to be implemented the method or we can declare the child class as abstract too.

=====================================================================================================================

Interfaces :
    - are contracts that classes implement. we can also achieve abstraction with interfaces.
Why we should use interfaces :
    1. They allow multiple inheritance;
    2. They don't have the issue of tightly coupled code.

Syntax to use interface :
    interface nameOfInterface {
    }
Rules:
    1. All variables in interfaces are public static final
    2. No instance variables
    3. Constructors are also not allowed
    4. By default methods are public and abstract
    5. a single class can implement many interfaces.
    6. an interface can extend another interface.
