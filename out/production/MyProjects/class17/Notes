Access Modifiers:

Access modifiers are keywords in java that help us control the access of classes, variables, methods and other code of block.
There are four access levels in java private default (its not a keyword) protected and public
We have 3 keywords that define access levels:
            1. Private
            2. Protective
            3. Public

Private :
    When we use the private keyboard with a method or field it is only accessible inside that class.
    It is the most restricted access modifier.

Default(its not a keyword):
    When we don't use any access modifier keyword with a field or a method then default access is applied by java,
    which means we can access this variable or method inside the same as well as in all the other classes which
    exists inside the same package

Protected:
    When we have protected access modifier we can access that matter or variable inside the same class + inside the
    other classes which are inside the same package + inside the classes which are in different packages as well but
    they must have a extends relationship with the original class.

Public:
    When we use the public access modifier we can use that field or method anywhere inside the same project.
