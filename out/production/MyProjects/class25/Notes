What is abstraction:
---> Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and only showing
the functionality. It's the 3rd pilar of OOps;

Why we should use abstraction:
---> it reduces the complexity by separating the ideas from implementations
---> we can also enforce rules om other classes

How can we use the abstraction:
---> we can use abstraction in our code with the help of abstract classes and interfaces
---> we can create abstract methods with only the header and mark the class as abstract now
---> every class that wil be inheriting from this class will either implement those methods
or mark the child class abstract as well

RULES:
1. abstract methods cant have a body
2. as soon as we have ine abstract method in a class that class must ne declared as abstract
3. once a class inherit from an abstract class that class must implement the abstract methods or it should be marked as abstract
4. it should be marked as abstract
5. we can have normal methods with body and abstract methods inside a class
6. we cant create the objects of abstract classes
7. we can have everything inside and abstract class that we have in a normal class only thing that differs
is we cant create the object of that class
